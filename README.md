# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.


So, basically I wanted to create a mockup version of instagram and a little touch of my own style to it.
I used an instagram tutorial and googled a lot since other people have tried to make an instagram mockup.
With the help of looking at other people's code, I had very minimal to code and focus just on designing it
similar to instagram, but with some different visual features.


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version- 2.3.7

* I made changes to the css and some of the code.
